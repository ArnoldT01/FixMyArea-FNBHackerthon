## Problem statement
How might we design solutions that improve access to reliable power, water, and transport, while empowering communities to better manage service disruptions ?

## About

Fix my area app enables residents to log power, water, or transport issues with details like disruption type, location, and photos. Reports are automatically routed to the relevant municipal department for faster resolution. Residents can track reports, while municipalities gain real-time insights into service disruptions, aiding resource prioritization, pattern monitoring, and data-driven decisions.


## Key Features

- Issue Reporting: Residents can easily submit reports with descriptions, photos, and location data.   
- Smart Routing: Automatically sends each issue to the relevant municipal department (e.g., roads, electricity, or water).  
- Real-Time Updates: Users can track the status of their submitted reports.  
- Community Transparency: View ongoing and resolved issues within your area.


## Tech Stack

- Frontend & App Logic: React Native + TypeScript
- Database: Supabase  


## Future Enhancements

- Integration with municipal CRM systems
- Voice-based issue reporting
- Reward system for active community reporters
- AI intergration ( Criticality analysis based on uploaded images )
